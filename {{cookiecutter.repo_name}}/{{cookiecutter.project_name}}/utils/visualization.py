"""This module contains utilities to visualize the different data created during processing.
In contrast to the other parts of this project the visualization utitlities are not
designed to be used as a pipeline/processor. Instead functions are provided that can be
used to visualize the data in a notebook or in a script.
Try to use functions which operate on matplotlib.Axes objects as this makes it easier
to combine the different visualizations.
